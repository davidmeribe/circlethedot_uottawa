This is was programming assignment for a course in the University of Ottawa.

This is a real game made by Ketchapp.

If you copy you are liable to be sued. I rest my case

NOTES:
The game works with very minor bugs.

BUGS:
Sometimes the bluedot escapes the diagonally, some faulty calculation somewhere.
I didn't complete the save game, undo and redo features. (I haven't had the time to complete it, maybe someday)

FINALLY:
Thanks for checking it out, feel free to correct and give me pointers. This is old code though, I promise I'm a bit better now :)
